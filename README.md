# Learning OpenGL 
Started learning OpenGL from scratch, so right now it's OpenGL 1.0(intermediate mode) specification

**Program opportunities**:
1. Tracking camera *that's rotating vertical from 0° to 85° and whole 360° horizontal (it also has zoom option)*
2. Real fps counter*: count frames and divide it on time every 1 second (almost, usually it's like 1.04sec)*
3. Count elapsed time by using windows functions
4. 4 teapots with different colors and degree

**Used libraries**:
1. [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) - open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library
2. [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) - C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications

**Program in action**
FPS in the title

Controls:
Arrows - Rotation *(up/down/left/right)*  
Mouse Wheel - Zoom *(close/further)*
